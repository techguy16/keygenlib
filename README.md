# keygenlib
A Python library to generate product keys.

## Using keygenlib
Put the library folder into the root folder of your project.
Open the file you want to use keygenlib in, then import the library using:
```python
from keygenlib import *
```

Then generate the keys using (you will need to add a variable or use print to get your keys):
```python
win95_retail()         # XXX-XXXXXXX
win95_oem()            # XXXXX-OEM-XXXXXXX-XXXX
elevendigit_retail()   # XXXX-XXXXXXX
```
